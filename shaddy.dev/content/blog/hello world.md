## Hello World

I've recently made some changes and updates to the site and theme to support blogging.
This came with an updated front page image credits to Lunecron#5256 (discord tag).

I have been holding out on pushing the changes for a while since, although I do want to get into blogging, I haven't yet written anything.
An empty blog would look a little strange.  
But I've decided it's time.
No point just letting it sit on my hard drive.  
So here we go.
My blog is out.  
Maybe there will be more content in the future.
